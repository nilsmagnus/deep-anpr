# Deep ANPR

 This project is heavily inspired by https://github.com/matthewearl/deep-anpr . 
 
 Work in progress, but something is working. 
 
 # The idea
 1. Syntethize training data with the type of number plate you want
 2. Use multilayer convolutional networks for training
 3. Train the network with endless counts of numberplates

#dependencies
 
The project has the following dependencies:

* [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org)
* OpenCV
* NumPy
